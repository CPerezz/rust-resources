# rust-resources
## A list with all the resources I find helpful when developing with Rust

### Macros
- https://danielkeep.github.io/tlborm/book/README.html (All you need about macros)

### Lifetimes
- https://tfpk.github.io/lifetimekata/index.html A lot of lifetimes content with some exercises (in case you feel like doing them).

### Complete Rust guides
- https://blessed.rs/crates A lot of crates and example suggestions for almost all of the imaginable topics that a Rust programmer will face. (Highly recommended!).
